    "To understand the timing in the detector, we need to describe how the data is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are electronics that continually stores a rolling queue of voltage versus time measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time between samples (sometimes called ticks) is determined by the electronics clock used. For MicroBooNE, the data acquisition system  (or DAQ) used to record the voltage versus time on all the wires saves a sample every 0.5 microseconds, i.e. 0.5 microseconds per tick.\n",
    "There is some amount of stored values in the electronics. Values are replaced in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every so often, a signal is sent to the electronics to save the stored values to disk.\n",
    "This signal is called the trigger.\n",
    "We use a number of different triggers. \n",
    "The primary one is a signal that comes a little bit ahead of when the neutrino beam will arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The saved data is arranged in time order and a window of data is defined. \n",
    "This is how the data is arranged from MicroBooNE.\n",
    "The tick that occured at the same time of the trigger is positioned to always be at `tick=3200`.\n",
    "The range of samples stored goes from 3200 ticks before the trigger and 6400 ticks after the trigger to a total window size of 9600 ticks.\n",
    "In order to save space, MicroBooNE in the first process of data processing removes the first 2400 ticks and 1152 ticks at the end for a truncated 6448 tick window.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code library, we retain this 2400-8448 tick range as the \"coordinate\" for the time axis of the image data.\n",
    "In otherwords, we say the first \"row\" of the image is at tick=2400 and the last row ends at tick=8448.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ionization left behind by charged particles in the detector arrive at the wireplanes and makes a signal in the electronics and thereby the image.  However, before the ionization arrives at the wireplane, the ionization must first drift from the location it was created to the wireplanes. Assuming a constant velocity (a first-order approximation we often use), the between the particle actually traveled the detector and the time the ionization shows up in the image is `(distance from wireplanes)/(drift velocity)`. The drift velocity depends on the electric field used in the detector. For MicroBooNE the drift velocity was measured to be around 0.111 cm per microseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original time of the trajectory (in others the real time) is known as the `t0` of the trajectory.\n",
    "The `t0_offset` is the drift time or `(distance from wireplanes)/(drift velocity)`.  So the time that the signal appears on the wire plane is `t = t0 + t0_offset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we find out this offset? Well, we actually are able to measure the original time of a trajectory.\n",
    "In addition to ionization, most trajectories will produce a sizable flash of scintillation light that is seen in the optical detectors.  The time of the event can be measured potentially by the light is at the nanoseconds level.  However, associating flashes of light in the optical system to the charged trajectories is not an easy task and is not something we can do at the start.  You first have to decide what signals or pixels in an image are due trajectories occuring nearly at the same time.  Then you need to match that spatial pattern of ionization with the amount and spatial pattern of light signals in the optical detectors.  As a result, the `t0_offset` for a trajectory cannot be subtracted out until the middle or later portions of the reconstrucion.\n",

    "This is all to explain why when we plot the truth trajectories using the `apply_t0_offset` flag, the tracks are outside the TPC. This is because their timing (and equivalently) their position is all relative to `tick=3200`.\n",
