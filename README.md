# ubdl

Collection of libraries for the (new) MicroBooNE DL Reconstruction Chain

## Modules Used

* [LArCV](https://github.com/larbys/larcv): image format IO library. Version 1 (as opposed to incompatible LArCV2 library).
  `ubdl_dev` branch which is quite different from LArCV1 version used in past chain.  Inroduces much of the chains in LArCV2.
  But does maintain some backwards-compatibility (just reading of old-LArCV1 input).
